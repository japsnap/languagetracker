# Changelog

## 2026-04-08

- **Server-side prompt lockdown** — client now sends only `{ word, direction, mode }`; all system prompts, model name, and token limits are hardcoded server-side in `api/anthropic.js`. Logged-in users can no longer modify prompts via DevTools.
- **Provider config object** — `api/anthropic.js` has a top-level `PROVIDER` constant so the AI backend (model, URL, key env var) can be swapped in one place.
- **Auth gate on `/api/anthropic`** — serverless function rejects unauthenticated requests with 401; verifies the Supabase session token before forwarding anything to the AI provider.
- **CLAUDE.md + security rules** — added project overview, coding conventions, and mandatory security rules (`.claude/rules/security.md`) for Claude Code sessions. Added `.env.*` to `.gitignore`.

## 2026-04-07

- **Google OAuth** — replaced the session-based password gate (`VITE_APP_PASSWORD`) with Google OAuth via Supabase Auth. Added `AuthProvider` context, `LoginPage`, and sign-out button in the nav. Removed `PasswordGate` component. Words saved by new users are now tagged with their Supabase `user_id`. The ~784 words imported from CSV were backfilled to owner UUID `fb1e35bb-49e2-4dd1-8ef7-b0f7e788198e`.

## 2026-04-06

- **Multi-meaning input** — default lookup uses a single cheap API call (one meaning); a "See more" button triggers a second call returning up to 3 meanings/translations.
- **Auto-correct accents** — AI prompts updated to correct spelling errors in the `word` field (e.g. `espanol → español`, `nino → niño`).
- **Level badge colors** — A1–C2 badges changed from greyscale to distinct colors (green/blue/purple/pink); consistent across Review, Quiz, and Input tabs.
- **Settings tab** — new tab with CSV export of the full vocabulary (BOM-encoded, all 15 fields, proper escaping).
- **Mobile nav fix** — navigation bar no longer overflows on small screens; app defaults to the Input tab on load.

## 2026-04-05

- **Design overhaul** — replaced warm Latin palette and Playfair Display font with minimal grey/black/white using Nunito throughout.
- **Level filter in Review** — multi-select A1–C2 toggle buttons to filter the word list by level.
- **Code splitting** — tabs (Review, Quiz, Input, Stats) are lazy-loaded with `React.lazy` + `Suspense`. Main bundle reduced from ~786 KB to ~189 KB.
- **C1 and C2 levels** — added throughout the app: input form, quiz, stats, sorting, and AI prompts.
- **EN→ES direction** — Input tab gained a direction toggle; English→Spanish lookup returns up to 3 candidate cards, each saved individually.
- **Password gate** — simple session-based password gate added using `VITE_APP_PASSWORD` env var (later replaced by Google OAuth on 2026-04-07).
- **Supabase migration** — data layer moved from `localStorage` to Supabase; added async loading/error states, seed script, and `supabase.js` client utility. ~784 words imported from `01042025_Spanishvocab.csv`.
- **Initial release** — full-featured app with Review, Quiz, Input, and Stats tabs. Stages 1–4 complete: vocabulary table, spaced-repetition quiz, Claude API word lookup (via Vercel serverless proxy), Recharts stats dashboard, scene tagging. Deployed to Vercel.
